## Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Engagement Focus**: Prioritizing user engagement over conversion metrics
- **Auto-Detection**: Screen flows discovered from data, not configured manually  
- **Timezone Strategy**: UTC for sequencing, local time for activity patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Tiered caching (15min general, 2min user journeys, 10min flows)

### Blockers & Risks
- None currently identified

### Resources Needed  
- Google Cloud BigQuery access credentials
- Healthcare onboarding data access
- Development environment setup
