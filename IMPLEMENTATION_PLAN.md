# Healthcare Onboarding Analytics Web Application - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a modern web application that connects directly to Google BigQuery to analyze healthcare platform onboarding data, focusing on **user engagement analysis** rather than traditional funnel conversion.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: .NET 8 Web API with Google Cloud BigQuery integration
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and Material-UI
- **Charts**: Chart.js with React integration
- **Caching**: Memory/Redis for performance optimization
- **Authentication**: Google Auth (future implementation)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (High Priority)
**Goal**: Establish core architecture and data connectivity

#### Backend Foundation
- [ ] Initialize .NET 8 Web API project
- [ ] Configure Google Cloud BigQuery integration
- [ ] Set up dependency injection and configuration
- [ ] Implement core data models:
  - `OnboardingEvent` - Maps from BigQuery events
  - `UserSession` - Engagement-focused session analysis
  - `UserJourney` - Individual user path tracking
- [ ] Create BigQuery service with basic connectivity

#### Frontend Foundation
- [ ] Initialize React TypeScript project
- [ ] Configure Material-UI and Chart.js dependencies
- [ ] Set up routing and basic layout structure
- [ ] Create API service layer for backend communication

### Phase 2: Core Analytics Engine (High Priority)
**Goal**: Implement engagement-focused analytics capabilities

#### Backend Analytics Services
- [ ] **BigQueryService**: Query optimization and data mapping
  - Event retrieval with timezone handling
  - Screen flow auto-detection queries
  - Caching integration
- [ ] **EngagementService**: Core engagement analysis
  - Engagement scoring algorithm (0-100+ points)
  - Stage progression tracking
  - Time investment analysis
- [ ] **UserJourneyService**: Individual user tracking
  - Complete user path visualization
  - Session analysis and drop-off detection
- [ ] **ScreenFlowService**: Auto-detected flow analysis
  - Dynamic screen transition discovery
  - Backward flow detection
  - Common path identification

#### API Controllers
- [ ] `EngagementController` - Aggregate engagement metrics
- [ ] `UserJourneyController` - Individual user analysis
- [ ] `ScreenFlowController` - Flow pattern analysis
- [ ] `BigQueryController` - Direct query interface

### Phase 3: Frontend Dashboard Components (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Create professional visualization interfaces

#### Chart Components
- [ ] `EngagementChart` - Engagement level distribution
- [ ] `TimeSeriesChart` - Temporal analysis
- [ ] `UserJourneyFlow` - Individual user path visualization
- [ ] `ScreenFlowDiagram` - Auto-detected flow patterns
- [ ] `ChartExporter` - PDF/Excel export capabilities

#### Dashboard Pages
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Executive summary view
- [ ] **EngagementAnalysis**: Detailed engagement metrics
  - Engagement level breakdown
  - Furthest stage analysis
  - Time investment patterns
- [ ] **UserJourney**: Individual user search and analysis
  - Email/UserID search interface
  - Timeline visualization
  - Journey insights
- [ ] **ScreenFlowAnalysis**: Flow pattern discovery
  - Auto-detected screen transitions
  - Drop-off point identification
  - Common path analysis

#### Custom Hooks
- [ ] `useEngagementData` - Engagement metrics fetching
- [ ] `useUserJourney` - Individual user data
- [ ] `useScreenFlow` - Flow analysis data
- [ ] `useBigQuery` - Direct BigQuery integration

### Phase 4: Performance & User Experience (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Optimize performance and enhance usability

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement intelligent caching strategy
  - 15-minute cache for general analytics
  - 2-minute cache for user journeys
  - 10-minute cache for screen flows
- [ ] Query optimization for sub-5 second responses
- [ ] Progressive loading for large datasets
- [ ] Memory management for large result sets

#### Global Features
- [ ] Timezone handling for worldwide healthcare workers
  - Local time analysis for activity patterns
  - Peak usage time identification
- [ ] Advanced filtering capabilities
- [ ] Real-time data refresh options

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
**Goal**: Add professional features and future-readiness

#### Export & Reporting
- [ ] PDF report generation
- [ ] Excel export functionality
- [ ] Custom report builder
- [ ] Scheduled report delivery

#### Authentication & Security
- [ ] Google Auth integration
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Data privacy compliance

#### Future-Ready Architecture
- [ ] A/B testing framework preparation
  - Feature flag data structure
  - Comparative analysis infrastructure
  - LaunchDarkly integration readiness
- [ ] Advanced analytics capabilities
- [ ] Real-time update infrastructure

## Key Metrics & Success Criteria

### Engagement Metrics (Primary Focus)
- **Furthest Stage Reached** - How far users progress
- **Time Invested** - Total time spent in onboarding
- **Screen Revisits** - Backward navigation (shows engagement)
- **Engagement Score** - 0-100+ point algorithm combining all factors
- **Engagement Levels** - Minimal, Light, Moderate, Highly Engaged

### Performance Targets
- Query response time: < 5 seconds
- Dashboard load time: < 3 seconds
- Concurrent users: 50+
- Data freshness: Real-time + intraday tables

### User Experience Goals
- Intuitive search for individual users
- Executive-ready visualizations
- Mobile-responsive design
- Export capabilities for presentations

## Technical Considerations

### BigQuery Integration
- Direct connection to production BigQuery
- Timezone-aware queries (UTC + local time)
- Chunked data reconstruction for large fields
- Intelligent query caching

### Data Models
- Engagement-focused rather than conversion-focused
- Auto-detection of screen flows (no manual configuration)
- Individual user journey tracking
- Future-ready for A/B testing data

### Architecture Decisions
- Clean separation between analytics engine and visualization
- Service-oriented backend design
- React hooks pattern for data fetching
- Material-UI for professional appearance
- Chart.js for advanced visualizations

## Risk Mitigation
- **BigQuery costs**: Implement query caching and optimization
- **Performance**: Progressive loading and intelligent caching
- **Data complexity**: Robust error handling and validation
- **Future changes**: Flexible, configuration-driven architecture

This implementation plan creates a production-ready healthcare onboarding analytics platform that transforms raw BigQuery data into actionable engagement insights for stakeholders at all levels.
